You can install the packages manually or with the requirements.txt file. The packages you would need to start the program are the following:

- PyGame
- Socket
- OS

There are some things you need to do before you can play the online mode. First, you need to change the SERVER_IP to the ip of the host on both clients. Then you need to check if the port (Currently: 5555) is free and open the internet.

Have fun :)
